are the detailed requirements for the Income module.

1. General UI / UX

The application should have a soft, friendly, and pleasant UI.

Even though this is a debt and finance app, the interface should feel calm and reassuring.

Use modern card-based design and clear typography.

2. Income Main Page (Dashboard)

At the top of the Income page, there should be two summary cards:

Monthly Expected Income

Cash Balance

3. Add Income Button

Below the summary cards, there should be an “Add Income (+)” button.

This button is used to create a new income entry.

4. Add Income Page (Separate Screen)

When the Add Income (+) button is clicked:

Open a new full page / screen, not a notification panel or toast.

This page is dedicated only to income creation and editing.

5. Income Entry Form

The Add Income page should include the following fields:

Income Name

Amount

Income Date

Recurring Income Checkbox

If recurring is enabled, allow selecting frequency:

Weekly

Monthly

Yearly

When an amount is entered and the income is recurring:

Automatically apply the same amount to future periods.

6. 24-Month Income Schedule Table

Below the form, display a 24-month schedule table with the following columns:

Income Name

Amount

Date

Table Behavior:

Amount field must be editable

Date field must be editable

Example:

For a monthly salary, I should be able to:

Change the amount for June only

Change the income date for June only

Editing one month must not affect other months unless explicitly changed.

7. Save Income

At the bottom of the page, place a Save button.

When saved:

Income entries should appear on the Income main page.

Summary cards (Monthly Expected Income and Cash Balance) must update accordingly.

8. Income Listing Rules

On the Income main page:

List incomes only for the currently selected month

Even if the income is recurring for 24 months, do not list all months

Example row format:

Salary | 62,000 | 05.02.2025 | Edit | Delete

9. Edit & Delete

Clicking Edit:

Opens the same Add Income page

Pre-filled with the selected income’s data

Clicking Delete:

Removes the income entry

10. Past Income Visibility

Do not show past months’ incomes by default.

Example:

If the current month is January, December incomes should not be visible.

11. Filtering & Reporting

Allow filtering the income list by:

Specific month (e.g., March)

Custom range (e.g., last 6 months)

When filtering:

The income list updates

Monthly Expected Income card updates based on the filter

12. Monthly Expected Income Logic

When no filter is applied:

Show the expected total income for the next month, calculated based on entered data

Example: “Expected income as of the 5th of next month”

When a filter is applied:

This value must reflect the filtered data only

13. Cash Balance Logic

Income entries should include a “Received” checkbox

Rules:

If income is not marked as received, it does NOT affect Cash Balance

When marked as received:

The amount is added to Cash Balance immediately

If income arrives earlier or later than expected:

User manually marks it as received when it actually arrives

14. Future Integration Note

Later, when Expenses and Debt modules are implemented:

Approved expenses and debt payments will deduct from Cash Balance

This logic should be designed to support future integration

EXPENSES MODULE – APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS (ENGLISH)

Below are the same rules adapted for the Expenses module.

1. General UI / UX

The Expenses module should visually match the Income module.

Maintain a calm, friendly, and modern design.

2. Expenses Main Page (Dashboard)

Monthly Planned Expenses

Cash Balance

3. Add Expense Button

This page is used for both adding and editing expenses.

5. Expense Entry Form

Fields required:

Expense Name

Amount

Expense Date

Recurring Expense Checkbox

Weekly

Monthly

Yearly

When recurring:

Automatically apply the same amount to future periods

6. 24-Month Expense Schedule Table

Only show expenses for the currently selected month

Do not list all 24 months

Example:

Past expenses should not be shown by default

11. Filtering & Reporting

Allow filtering by:

Month

Custom range (e.g., last 6 months)

Without filters:

Show total planned expenses for the next month

With filters:

Show totals based only on filtered data

13. Cash Balance Interaction

Expenses should include a “Paid” checkbox

Rules:

If not marked as paid → no effect on Cash Balance

When marked as paid → deduct amount from Cash Balance

If paid early or late → user controls payment confirmation manually

14. Future Integration Note

This module must integrate with:

Income module

Debt tracking module

Cash Balance must always reflect approved incomes minus approved expenses and debts



I am building a personal finance and debt repayment application.

Income and Expense modules already exist.
Now I want to create a new module called **Banks & Debts** and integrate it with Income and Expense data.

GENERAL GOAL:
After incomes and expenses are entered, on the 5th day of each month, the system should distribute the remaining expected income to bank debts according to strict rules.

--------------------------------------------------
1. BANKS & DEBTS PAGE – GENERAL STRUCTURE
--------------------------------------------------

• Create a page called **Banks & Debts**
• The UI should be clean, friendly, and calm (this is a debt payment app).
• Use cards and soft colors.
• Each bank should be displayed as a separate card.

--------------------------------------------------
2. ADD BANK / DEBT FORM
--------------------------------------------------

Add a button: **Add Bank Debt**

When clicked, open a new full-page form (not a popup).

Fields:
- Bank Name
- Debt Type (Credit Card / Overdraft / KMH / Flexible Account)
- Total Debt Amount
- Interest Rate (%)
- Interest Type (Daily interest / Monthly interest)
- Minimum Payment Amount
- Payment Due Day (default: 5)
- Is this debt active? (checkbox)

Save button at the bottom.

--------------------------------------------------
3. BANK LIST ON MAIN PAGE
--------------------------------------------------

On the Banks & Debts main page:
List all banks with the following columns:

- Bank Name
- Debt Type
- Total Remaining Debt
- Minimum Payment
- Interest Rate
- Payment Status (Paid / Pending)
- View Plan button

Past months should not be shown.
Only current and future months are visible.

--------------------------------------------------
4. MONTHLY PAYMENT LOGIC (VERY IMPORTANT)
--------------------------------------------------

Every month, on the 5th day:

Use **EXPECTED INCOME**, not cash balance.

Step 1:
• Subtract all expenses for the month.
• Calculate remaining expected income.

Step 2:
• Pay ONLY the minimum payment to ALL banks.

Step 3:
• After minimum payments are completed,
  send **ALL remaining money to ONLY ONE bank**.

Step 4:
The selected bank must meet ALL of these criteria:
• Highest interest rate
• Interest is calculated daily
• Debt type is Credit Card or KMH

If multiple banks qualify, choose the one with the highest remaining debt.

--------------------------------------------------
5. PAYMENT PLAN GENERATION
--------------------------------------------------

For each bank:
• Automatically generate a monthly payment plan.
• Show:
  - Month
  - Starting Debt
  - Interest Added
  - Payment Made
  - Remaining Debt

When the user clicks **View Plan**, open a detailed payment schedule page for that bank.

--------------------------------------------------
6. INTEGRATION WITH INCOME & EXPENSES
--------------------------------------------------

• Payment calculations must use:
  - Expected income (not cash)
  - Approved expenses
• Cash balance should not be reduced until payments are confirmed.

--------------------------------------------------
7. PAYMENT CONFIRMATION
--------------------------------------------------

• Each bank payment must have a checkbox: "Payment completed"
• When checked:
  - Reduce cash balance
  - Update remaining debt
• If unchecked, do NOT reduce cash balance.

--------------------------------------------------
8. FILTERING & MONTH VIEW
--------------------------------------------------

• Allow filtering by month (e.g. March, next 6 months)
• Bank list and totals should update according to selected filter.
• Monthly totals must reflect filtered data.

--------------------------------------------------
9. RULES & CONSTRAINTS
--------------------------------------------------

• Never pay more than available expected income.
• Never skip minimum payments.
• Never split extra money between multiple banks.
• Extra payment always goes to ONE bank only.
• Calculations must be transparent and explainable.

--------------------------------------------------
10. TECHNICAL NOTES
--------------------------------------------------

• Use reusable components.
• State must persist after refresh.
• Make the logic easy to extend later.
• Prepare the system so future automation can be added.

Build this module as part of the same application and ensure full integration with existing Income and Expense modules.
